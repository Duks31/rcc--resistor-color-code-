# Resistor Color Code Calculator

![Demo...v1](/assests/demo.png)

Not the best... A simple C++ application for calculating the resistance and tolerance of a resistor based on its color bands. This project provides a console-based interface for users to input the color bands of a resistor, and it outputs the resistor's resistance value and tolerance.

## Features

- Input resistor color bands interactively through the console.
- Calculate and display the resistance value in ohms.
- Show the tolerance percentage of the resistor.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Duks31/rcc--resistor-color-code-.git

2. **Compile the source code using g++:**

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o resistor-color-code-calculator

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   ./resistor-color-code-calculator

4. **Follow the instructions to input the color bands of the resistor.**

## Future Work

This project is a simple implementation of a resistor color code calculator. Future work may include:

- Adding support for 5-band resistors.
- Creating a GUI-based application for a more user-friendly experience.
- Adding support for reverse calculation of the color bands based on the resistance and tolerance values.
